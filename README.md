# funneler_exe
A standalone application which generates a BigQuery-dialect SQL query to build a funnel against Google Analytics page-hit data, based on an input json., which accompanies an upcoming blog post on Online Behavior. To use, modify data\input.json and run funneler.exe. Then copy/paste the output query into BQ.
